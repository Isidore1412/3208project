# MongoDB allows connections without password.
# But that doesn't fly with Adminer which prints 'Database does not support password.' for such case.
#
# Jakub Vrana (Adminer author says): (https://sourceforge.net/p/adminer/bugs-and-features/635/#429d)
#   This is what Adminer does:
#   1. Connect with password.
#   2. If it fails, report the error.
#   3. If it succeeds, try to connect without the password.
#   4. If it succeeds, report "Database does not support password." because otherwise anyone can connect to your database using Adminer.
#   5. If it fails, continue normally.
#
# So it's clearly expected and documented behaviour that Adminer refuses to log in even
# if the credentials are fine as long as it's also possible to log in without password.
#
# To combat this, we would remove the empty password check in the minified adminer.php version.
# In the source file, it's these two lines that would be removed https://github.com/vrana/adminer/blob/2780eb01f5b100a5b4657c4688b9f44d1ef825fe/adminer/drivers/mongo.inc.php#L626-L627
#
# This is a part of the minified adminer.php file which contains those two lines:
# Min_DB;list($N,$V,$F)=$b->credentials();$yf=array();if($V.$F!=""){$yf["username"]=$V;$yf["password"]=$F;}$m=$b->database();if($m!="")$yf["db"]=$m;try{$h->_link=$h->connect("mongodb://$N",$yf);if($F!=""){$yf["password"]="";try{$h->connect("mongodb://$N",$yf);return
# lang(22);}catch(Exception$Ac){}}return$h;}catch(Exception$Ac){return$Ac->getMessage();}}function
#
# and by the sed below, we remove the contents of the try catch block:
# Min_DB;list($N,$V,$F)=$b->credentials();$yf=array();if($V.$F!=""){$yf["username"]=$V;$yf["password"]=$F;}$m=$b->database();if($m!="")$yf["db"]=$m;try{$h->_link=$h->connect("mongodb://$N",$yf);if($F!=""){$yf["password"]="";try{
# }catch(Exception$Ac){}}return$h;}catch(Exception$Ac){return$Ac->getMessage();}}function
